**ReadMe.md**

*Readme document for the Coursera/Johns Hopkins University Getting & Cleaning Data project*

This Github repository contains:

*ReadMe.md* (this file) that describes the files contained in the repository and summarizes their purpose, including that of the R script.

*CodeBook.md* that describes the variables in the original dataset, the transformations that were carried out using the R script, and the resulting variables that were produced in order to satisfy the requirements of the assigment.

*run_analysis.R* the R script needed to transform the original data supplied for the Coursera/Johns Hopkins University Getting & Cleaning Data project into the data needed to generate a tidy dataset of means, and to generate that tidy dataset.

The original dataset downloaded from the source URL is not included in this repository, but the R script shows how it was obtained.

The tidy dataset of means is not enclosed in this Github repository, it has been uploaded separately for assessment, but the CodeBook.md enclosed describes what it contains.
